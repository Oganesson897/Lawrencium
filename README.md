# Lawrencium

**HEAVY WIP & CANNOT PROMISE PLAYABLE**

Lawrencium is an Unofficial Fork of FiniteReality's ["embeddium"](https://github.com/FiniteReality/embeddium), ported to 1.12.2 and made to work with Forge Mod Loader.
This mod is based Asek3's [Vintagium](https://github.com/Asek3/sodium-1.12).

# Why forked
Maybe Asek is tired and I want to use sodium in 1.12.2.  
I am trying to do something I can.  
I'll make some changes that I like, like delet FASM compatible.  
If Asek comes back, I'll PR new features to Vintagium.

# Why change Mod ID
Embeddium / Sodium / Vintagium  
I dont want to use any of them.  
I'll standardize those IDs.  

## Disclaimer
Not and never will be compatible with OptiFine

# Lawrencium

(MACHINE TRANSLATE)

Since I don't think I'll be able to do all the things everyone wants (and I want to do myself) for a while, I'm going to stop updating this repository for a while to prevent more people from seeing him and thinking that I'm doing serious work, and the truth is that my knowledge of renderers is very limited, and I'm trying to do more on the private side of things.  
 So the project is back to Vintagium's level for now (I haven't done anything except add useless Kotlin code and remove FermiumASM compatibility), and you still won't get anything even if you install it, so for now the community developers should still be encouraged to make a better sodium-1.12.2 (as of now it looks like Lawrencium's process will be and its slow, I bet you still won't see anything until the next Sodium comes out).  
 Including real world problems and more reasons that can't be stated publicly, I'll do whatever I can (for now) but won't publicize them until I'm completely done with the project.  
 I didn't have any way to release this text after privatizing the repository, so I updated the README.

**HEAVY WIP & CANNOT PROMISE PLAYABLE**

Lawrencium is an Unofficial Fork of FiniteReality's ["embeddium"](https://github.com/FiniteReality/embeddium), ported to 1.12.2 and made to work with Forge Mod Loader.
This mod is based Asek3's [Vintagium](https://github.com/Asek3/sodium-1.12).

# Why forked
Maybe Asek is tired and I want to use sodium in 1.12.2.  
I am trying to do something I can.  
I'll make some changes that I like, like delet FASM compatible.  
If Asek comes back, I'll PR new features to Vintagium.

# Why change Mod ID
Embeddium / Sodium / Vintagium  
I dont want to use any of them.  
I'll standardize those IDs.  

## Disclaimer
Not and never will be compatible with OptiFine
